# hello! welcome to the terminator's individual scripts!
- you can use these to isolate an individual stage of the penetration test, instead of using terminator.py.

<> note: terminator.py contains all the indiv scripts and is the primary method for using the terminator tool; therefore, the individual scripts might not be as up to date or production ready! 
- feel free to leave a comment or suggestion for making the tool better

*report.py will likely not function properly if the individual scripts are used; so, to ensure proper report.py functionality, please use terminator.py*
